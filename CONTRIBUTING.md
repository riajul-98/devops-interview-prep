## Development Workflow

### Setup
```bash
make setup          # Full development setup
make install-dev    # Install in development mode
make install-pre-commit  # Install git hooks
```

### Code Quality
```bash
make format         # Format code (black, isort)
make lint          # Run linters (flake8, mypy)
make test          # Run test suite
make check         # Run all quality checks
```

### Testing
```bash
make test          # Run all tests
make test-fast     # Skip slow tests
make test-cov      # Generate coverage report
```

## Question Guidelines

### Question Structure
```json
{
  "id": "topic-###",
  "topic": "aws|kubernetes|docker|linux|git|networking|terraform|cicd|security|monitoring|ansible|azure",
  "difficulty": "easy|medium|hard",
  "question": "Clear, specific question",
  "options": ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3", "Option 4"],
  "correct_answer": 2,
  "explanation": "Detailed explanation with reasoning",
  "scenario": "Real-world context (optional)",
  "company_tags": ["faang", "startup", "enterprise"],
  "real_world_context": "How this applies in practice (optional)"
}
```

### Quality Standards

**Good Questions:**
- Test understanding, not memorization
- Include realistic scenarios
- Have clear, unambiguous answers
- Provide educational explanations

**Avoid:**
- Trick questions or gotchas
- Overly specific syntax questions
- Questions with subjective answers
- Outdated technologies

### Difficulty Levels
- **Easy**: Fundamental concepts, basic commands
- **Medium**: Practical scenarios, troubleshooting
- **Hard**: Architecture decisions, complex debugging

## Code Style

This project uses:
- **Black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting  
- **flake8** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking

Run `make format lint` before committing.

## Testing

### Writing Tests
```python
# tests/test_new_feature.py
import pytest
from devops_ip.cli import InterviewSession

def test_session_scoring():
    session = InterviewSession(track_progress=False)
    assert session.score == 0
    assert session.total == 0
```

### Test Categories
- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions
- **Integration tests**: Test CLI commands
- **Slow tests**: Mark with `@pytest.mark.slow`
